README for FF-POC repository and project

The intention of this project is to demonstrate methods to transform the 
disclosure vehicle of the Hydraulic Fracking industry (FracFocus.org) into 
a usable research database.

FracFocus has been in operation since 2011 and the code presented here 
operates on a bulk download from the site.  As required by FracFocus, all 
variables in the raw data are presented unmodified.  All original FracFocus 
fields can be identified by an upper-case character in the first position.  All
fields generated by the code in this project have a lower-case character in
the first position (for example: CASNumber vs bgCAS)
