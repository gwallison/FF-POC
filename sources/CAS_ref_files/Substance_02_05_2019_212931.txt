FIELD Definition Field:This category encompasses the various chemical substances manufactured in the production of inorganic glasses.  For purposes of this category, "glass" is defined as an amorphous, inorganic, transparent, translucent or opaque material traditionally formed by fusion of sources of silica with a flux, such as an alkali-metal carbonate, boron oxide, etc. and a stabilizer, into a mass which is cooled to a rigid condition without crystallization in the case of transparent or liquid-phase separated glass or with controlled crystallization in the case of glass-ceramics.  The category consists of the various chemical substances, other than by-products or impurities, which are formed during the production of various glasses and concurrently incorporated into a glass mixture.  All glasses contain one or more of these substances, but few, if any, contain all of them.  The elements listed below are principally present as components of oxide systems but some may also be present as halides or chalcogenides, in multiple oxidation states, or in more complex compounds.  Trace amounts of other oxides or chemical compounds may be present.  Oxides of the first seven elements listed* comprise more than 95 percent, by weight, of the glass produced.
